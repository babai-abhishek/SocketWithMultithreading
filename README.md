# SocketWithMultithreading (Java)

This repository contains a Java implementation demonstrating socket programming with multithreading. It's a simple demonstration of how to create a multi-threaded server using sockets in Java.

## Overview

Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. It is widely used for networking and communication protocols.

This project focuses on implementing a server-client model where the server can handle multiple clients simultaneously using multithreading. Each client can connect to the server, send messages, and receive responses.

## Features

- **Multithreading**: The server can handle multiple client connections concurrently using threads.
- **Simple Client-Server Interaction**: Clients can connect to the server, send messages, and receive responses.
- **Basic Error Handling**: The code includes basic error handling to deal with exceptions that may occur during socket operations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/babai-abhishek/SocketWithMultithreading.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd SocketWithMultithreading
    ```

3. Compile the server and client Java files:

    ```bash
    javac Server.java
    javac Client.java
    ```

4. Run the server:

    ```bash
    java Server
    ```

5. Run one or multiple clients:

    ```bash
    java Client
    ```

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
